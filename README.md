**Any website, within reach of any agent.**

anybridge turns a website into tools an AI agent can actually use. It opens the
page in a real browser and re-exposes it over the **Model Context Protocol**, so
Claude Code, Codex, or anything else that speaks MCP can read the page, fill its
forms, click its buttons and read its PDFs — including sites built long before
agents existed.

Run it, pick your agent, paste a URL into it. That is the whole flow.

## Why it exists

[WebMCP](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webmcp) lets a website declare
typed, callable tools for AI agents. It is real and already deployed — Shopify
ships it on storefronts today — but only Gemini in Chrome can consume those
tools. anybridge captures them and hands them to **every other agent**.

And when a site has no WebMCP at all, which is almost every site, anybridge
generates the bridge itself from the live DOM. A 2013 SharePoint portal and a
modern Shopify store come out the same way: as a list of tools.

## What an agent gets

Two sources of tools, merged, with the site's own taking precedence:

**The site's native WebMCP tools**, namespaced so a page can never shadow a
built-in — `search_catalog`, `update_cart`, whatever the site registered.

**Forty universal tools that work on any page.** The ones that matter most:

| | |
|---|---|
| `navigate`, `read_page`, `smart_read` | open and read, with PDFs returned as page-marked text |
| `snapshot` | a compact semantic tree with stable refs (`@e12`) instead of raw HTML |
| `click_ref`, `fill_ref`, `select_ref`, `press_key` | act on those refs |
| `extract`, `screenshot`, `wait_for` | structured data, images, synchronisation |
| `save_site`, `save_profile`, `save_workflow` | remember a site, a login, a recorded flow |
| `open_repository` | clone a Git remote and hand back a local path |

## Run it

One command, nothing installed. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) fetches
anybridge and its Python for you, and anybridge downloads its browser on first
run:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/JustVugg/anybridge anybridge
```

That opens the TUI: pick your agent, and anybridge launches it in a second
terminal already wired to the bridge.

To keep it around, install it properly (Python 3.10 or newer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JustVugg/anybridge.git
cd anybridge
pip install -e .
```

On a bare Linux box `sudo playwright install-deps chromium` supplies Chromium's
system libraries. Not on PyPI yet.

## Use it

**Wire it into an MCP client:**

```bash
claude mcp add anybridge -- anybridge serve
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anybridge": { "command": "anybridge", "args": ["serve"] }
  }
}
```

**Or from the shell, with no agent at all:**

```bash
anybridge list https://www.bauzaar.it/     # the site's WebMCP tools plus the built-ins
anybridge call https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome read_page
```

**Or as a library**, when you want tools your framework already understands:

```python
from anybridge import BridgeSession
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

async with BridgeSession("https://www.bauzaar.it/") as site:
    agent = create_react_agent("anthropic:claude-sonnet-5", site.langchain_tools())
```

`site.anthropic_tools()`, `site.openai_tools()` and `site.tool_specs()` cover the
other frameworks. One browser backs the whole session, so calls share page state.

## How it holds up

**It picks the cheapest route that works.** Plain HTTP first, then optional
Lightpanda, and Chromium only when the page truly needs JavaScript or state.

**It stays available.** Every route is bounded by one shared deadline. If the
live site fails, anybridge degrades to a durable cache and finally to the
Internet Archive — and says so, instead of pretending an action succeeded.

**PDFs are text, never screenshots.** Chromium's PDF viewer exposes an empty
DOM, so anybridge extracts the document, marks every page, and lets an agent
ask for `pages="12-15"` of a long one.

**Untrusted pages stay in their box.** Remote sessions get their own browser,
private-network targets are blocked including across redirects, saved profiles
are encrypted and scoped to one origin, and recorded workflows never store the
values that were typed into them.

### Private-site dependencies

Strict private-site isolation does not disable the browser. The site's own
origin remains available, while unrelated hosts are blocked. If an internal
application uses additional API, authentication, asset, or service hosts,
explicitly allow those hosts with `ANYBRIDGE_PRIVATE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

For example, a Planful development environment that intentionally uses
multiple `*.planfuldev.com` hosts can run with:

```bash
ANYBRIDGE_PRIVATE_ALLOWED_HOSTS="*.planfuldev.com" anybridge serve
```

Only use a wildcard for a domain you control/trust. Do not add public
analytics, advertising, telemetry, or unknown third-party hosts if the goal
is to keep private-site data inside the private boundary.
## Limits

Aggressive anti-bot walls can still refuse a headless browser. When that
happens anybridge reports what the page actually served and continues read-only
from another source — it never invents a completed purchase, login or form
submission. Archived pages are historical and cannot be used for live actions.

## Development

```bash
python -m pytest tests/                                              # 49 tests
ANYBRIDGE_SKIP_BROWSER_TESTS=1 python -m unittest discover -s tests   # without a browser
```
